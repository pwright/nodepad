Most AI tools are built around a chat interface: you ask, it answers, you ask again. The interaction is sequential, conversational, and optimised for producing output. nodepad is built around a different premise: that thinking is spatial and associative, and that AI is most useful when it works quietly in the background rather than at the centre of attention.

You add notes. The AI classifies them, finds connections between them, surfaces what you haven't said yet, and occasionally synthesises an emergent insight from the whole canvas. You stay in control of the space. The AI earns its place by being genuinely useful rather than prominent.

## How it works

Notes are typed into the input bar and placed onto a spatial canvas. Each note is automatically classified into one of 14 types — claim, question, idea, task, entity, quote, reference, definition, opinion, reflection, narrative, comparison, thesis, general — and enriched with a short annotation that adds something the note doesn't already say.

Connections between notes are inferred from content. When you hover a connection indicator, unrelated notes dim. When enough notes accumulate, a synthesis emerges — a single sentence that bridges the tensions across the canvas. You can solidify it into a thesis note or dismiss it.

Three views: **tiling** (spatial BSP grid), **kanban** (grouped by type), **graph** (force-directed, centrality-radial).

## Setup

**Requirements**: a desktop browser and an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mskayyali/nodepad.git
cd nodepad
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Add your API key**: click the menu icon (top-left) → Settings → paste your OpenRouter key. The key is stored in your browser's `localStorage` and goes directly to OpenRouter — it never passes through any server.

**Enable web grounding** (optional): toggle "Web grounding" in Settings to let the AI cite real sources for claims, questions, and references. Works with models that support the `:online` suffix.

## Models

Select from the sidebar Settings panel. Default is GPT-4o.

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| `openai/gpt-4o` | Default. Strong annotation quality. |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | Strong reasoning, good for complex research. |
| `google/gemini-2.5-pro` | Supports web grounding. |
| `deepseek/deepseek-chat` | Fast, cost-effective. |
| `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2` | Lightweight, supports grounding. |

---

## Keyboard shortcuts

| | |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Add note |
| `⌘K` | Command palette (views, navigation, export) |
| `⌘Z` | Undo |
| `Escape` | Deselect / close panels |

Double-click any note to edit. Click the type label to reclassify manually.

## Plugins

Optional features can be shipped in-repo but kept disabled by default. See [plugins.md](plugins.md) for the current plugin model and how to enable the included `Blockscape` plugin.

---

## Data

Everything lives in your browser. No account, no server, no database.

- Notes are persisted to `localStorage` under `nodepad-projects`
- A silent rolling backup is written on every change to `nodepad-backup`
- Export to `.md` or `.nodepad` (versioned JSON) via `⌘K`
- Import `.nodepad` files via the sidebar
